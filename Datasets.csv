72,B001E4KFG0,"What to say? My daughter LOVES him and I with her. Very soft, zero visible seams, tender and especially functional. It reproduces according to the choice of music, white noise, the sound of the Breath or heartbeat. Also the otter tummy lights up and moves as if breathing. For the newborn is a real comfort in the cradle, always kept in safety, I place it away from his face so that he can perceive it even just by touching it with his hand. Wonderful purchase, we are really happy!",Twitter,5,11-01-20,43,1
85,B00813GRG4,"I decided to test this plush to my grandson, just three years old. As soon as he saw it he was very happy and he exclaimed it was: ""Zia, it's very soft!"" Actually the plush is really soft to the touch and a real companion for the nights, of our children. The animal represented is a gray otter, a toy animal that is able to help children play and also relax, during the night and during the time they rest. This otter is able to emit vibrations that calm and relax the child, but also of music, very sweet. It is suitable for babies from 0 months up, let's say until 3-4 years of age. In any case, even if the kids get bigger, will remain his companion at night and play. An aspect that struck me, it was the fact of having used the sounds of nature, to relax and calm the little ones and I have to say that they really work. The sounds have a length of about half-hour. Our bright effects are also attractive in the AAA.",Facebook,5,09-10-22,36,1
107,B000LQOCH0,"An unusual pet, this otter is beautiful! Cute melodies, light in the tummy and fantastic ""breath"" mode.. I bought it to put it near my 2 month old baby when sleeps because he likes contact very much, it didn't work but we love it when wake up!!:) only flaws the price a little 'high even if much lower than the store",Amazon,5,08-12-22,2,1
109,B000UA0QIQ,"Beautiful, soft and very relaxing. It comes with behind (back) the keys you can select (-/+ for the volume, the notes for the type of music to select, the type of noise you want to put (heart beat, white noise etc, the belly moving or not, the light on or off).. all these keys are great and customizable depending on what the baby wants. My (10 months) is used to sleeping with the music box all night long and otter has a duration of 30 Min, but alas I wouldn't know if she might like it since she doesn't sleep absolutely with puppets.. but I can say that to this she has become fond of in a hurry (which is very strange).. we will see in the next nights if I can introduce her into the dwarfs!! Anyway recommended purchase, the only flaw is that 5.99 euro shipping is too much!!! At the end it costs less in the store!!",Flipcart,4,04-02-21,1,1
113,B006K2ZZ7K,"Plush tender, my 16-month-old loves it, sleeps hugged and cuddles him even when he wakes up. I put four stars because unfortunately, at least in my case, the mechanism that makes the belly of the puppet raise and lower emits an annoying hum. However, it remains effective in the function of the white noises and of the breath, that reconcile the sleep to my baby accompanying her towards a deep sleep and now is for her an indispensable companion! It does not do miracles, if sleeplessness or agitation are due to other ailments (e.g. identification) you have to intervene to solve those, but even in these cases the plush helps the child at least to relax and comfort, along with the cuddles of mom and dad, obviously!",Instagram,4,21-02-20,2,1
115,B006K2ZZ7K,"I love it, simply. I bought it after seeing it in a shop, I fell in love with it right away. Very soft and relaxing. The sounds are lovely and the heart movement is simply divine!!",Flipcart,5,12-11-22,3,1
116,B006K2ZZ7K,"Beautiful product, the only problem and that the puppet has little padding so you feel a lot the plastic of the internal machine. Despite that, my 2.5 year old adores it, and sleeps hugged every night.",Amazon,5,25-10-22,5,1
125,B006K2ZZ7K,"Perfect!! Relaxed very much my son of 4 months, it was a salvation especially to promote sleep and relieve a little the small problems of the teeth and colics. Before he slept only in his arms or anyway he had to feel my contact now I can relax because he relaxes also with this nice otter",Flipcart,5,07-08-20,2,1
138,B000E7L2R4,"The otter accompanies the dwarfs of my baby with its sweet melodies, much prettier than those of the music box that I had bought her. It is very soft and, if you put the breath mode, raises and lowers the belly.( the batteries with this mode are consumed at the speed of light though) Otherwise you can only put the music mode and set the volume. (the keys are behind the plush). It is easy to wash, just remove the envelope from the rigid inside through a zip.",Amazon,5,25-04-20,,1
146,B00171APVA,"Functional carillon, my 4 month old girl falls asleep listening to the melodies that play sweetly for 30 minutes. I find it useless everything else (breath and various sounds) and I don't know if maybe the light can serve later. The design is bad, this animal nn is not at all nice to see for the little ones, so much so that I had to make some changes (put a pink dress, add a bow in the head and create the eyes). The controls are inside the puppet and therefore not practical: if the baby sleeps awake with the noise of the tear that gives access to the various buttons. For what it is, it is really too expensive.",Facebook,2,23-11-20,,1
155,B0001PB9FE,A little expensive but my baby likes it to death. It has several sounds and the light on the tummy helps to make her fall asleep.Along with the rhythmic movement of the abdomen and the sound of the heart beating makes my baby fall asleep in no time... recommended!,Twitter,5,21-01-20,1,0
166,B0009XLVG0,"This plush is gorgeous!! I bought it for my 6-month-old to help him sleep alone. Actually the otter was literally kidnapped by my 2-year-old son. He fell in love with the belly that goes up and down and doesn't want to be without it anymore. The otter is fantastic easy to wash. Even the music adjustments, tummy light up and down are easy to set up. I'm really happy with the purchase.",Amazon,5,11-10-20,,1
172,B0009XLVG0,"The sounds (adjustable volume fortunately), the light on the tummy and the slow but continuous movement of the breath relax the child, so much so that he falls asleep even hugged!It is not very soft, at least not where there is the electronic part, but it is not dangerous.",Instagram,5,22-07-20,,1
194,B001GVISJM,"I loved this plush already from the photos and descriptions and when I received it confirmed my expectations! I took it for my baby of 5 months and when I never discovered it before!! The noises of the womb make him fall asleep practically immediately! The melodies are really relaxing, you can adjust the volume (and it is not a trivial thing) the tummy that moves is really nice to see! You can program the function (for example melody + light or breath + light...) that we want to make the baby listen and then just press the button on the belly and then goes on for 30 min then turns off. The only defect is that the buttons to change programming are behind and closed by a strap (safer method for the baby but equally noisy).. If there was a small zip of those missing would be better! For the rest the extra advice! Quality report - great price!",Flipcart,5,14-12-20,,1
195,B001GVISJM,"Wonderful in all this otter! Soft, even considering that it has a great deal inside, beautiful music, soft noises, nice face and cuddle... Perfect!",Amazon,5,16-11-22,2,1
199,B001GVISJM,"Puppet really cute. Various functions including heartbeat, breathing, relaxing music. Beautiful the function of the tummy that moves as if breathing. At the moment does not do the calming effect hoped for for my baby girl (maybe she is too small having only 7months) but I hope for the future.",Flipcart,4,10-11-20,,1
201,B001GVISJM,"Fantastic, various music and white noises including a nice sound of snoring and heartbeat, has a light on the sandwich that lights up, and the sandwich simulates the movement of the breath, recommended",Amazon,5,20-10-20,1,1
229,B001GVISJM,"Beautiful, soft, great audio, the case sounds good. Sweet melodies, heartbeat sounds and very relaxing breathing. Beautiful also the bed-shaped packaging. The electronics are easily removed to wash the plush. Batteries included. Very recommended as a gift.",Facebook,5,28-11-20,,1
235,B001GVISJM,"Soft plush with relaxing music. Very useful. The tummy moves up and down, almost like the melt of a cat. Easy to wash in the washing machine, after removing the internal mechanism. Put also in the dryer.Two defects... the mechanism inside, easily removable, is very heavy, and needs 4 batteries that are discharged quite quickly.",Twitter,5,10-12-22,,1
237,B001GVISJM,"Cute and useful for the bed, we use it x sleep it when the repertoire of lullaby runs out! Once asleep we leave it on in the cradle so as to limit the awakenings.. It turns off alone after a half hour.use little the functions breath and light, colors a little off, from awake nn attract a lot x play.",Instagram,4,07-02-21,,1
243,B001GVISJM,"I bought it for my grandson who is now two and a half months old. When I took it he was just 10 days old and maybe he was too young to appreciate it. Instead, starting from the second month we put him close to him with the music and he falls asleep or calms down or stays awake but entertains him. I think it's a great game even when he will be a little bigger. Now he only listens to all the sounds that the otter transmits, maybe more there will also appreciate the fact that the new belly and the light on.",Flipcart,5,19-09-20,,1
244,B001GVISJM,"My little 6 months old hugs her while she sleeps!... she washes quietly in the washing machine and even the batteries can be changed not as I read in another review.. it's very nice, a little rumorous when she breathes, but it's really sweet",Amazon,5,19-08-20,,1

258,B001GVISJM,It's really nice and soft. It's useful to raise and lower the volume according to your needs and to be able to select the function that one prefers at the moment. The only small defect is the fact that it's a bit noisy the movement that reproduces the breath.It's a purchase that I recommend.,Amazon,4,26-01-20,,1
269,B001GVISJM,"Plush very cuddly, if you press the tummy you turn on the soft light and start automatically the relaxing music rotating together with the breath.

1316,B0019CW0HE,"It works! And it's the most important thing! It helps a lot both to relax, that to accompany the children towards the bed, but it works well also as anti-stress, for those moments when the puppets tend to be more ""soundy"" or they feel neglected. Excellent pet this otter! (even if many will exchange it for a bear...), it turns out to be much more useful than expected. If you don't find it disturbing! Actually the breath, with movement, colors and sounds, is very realistic. In fact you can set noises, relaxing sounds (also human like the heartbeat) and music. You can match us a soft light on the belly, and see it move following the breath. Everything is customizable and can be activated by the battery pack, which has a rather tenacious button, to prevent it from starting inadvertently. The integrated timer is about 30 minutes! Shuttering the battery pack, you can also wash in the washing machine! Also, I would have a little flaw for the rest, I would have been finely padded to the rest of the rest of the material!",Flipcart,5,13-11-22,6,1
1320,B0019CW0HE,"This otter has a very good look and super tender; it is made of polyester and is really soft. It is beige with the inner part of the ears and the plants of the feet in blue fabric. Even the inside of the codina is made of fabric with a lovely drawing of small fishes. The eyes are closed and the arms are sewn to the chest, but they are absolutely not attached to the body, so you can fit a small hand. The dimensions are 25 x 15,5 x 11 cm. and weighs almost half a kilo, because inside, closed by a velcro, it hosts a battery, gigantic, which allows you to adjust the volume and choose which sound you want to listen to your baby through keys with very clear designs. In fact, you can choose between soft music or some relaxing sounds (white noises, sounds of the womb, breath during sleep or heartbeat).",Amazon,5,12-10-22,4,1
1322,B0019CW0HE,"I took this delicious otter for my grandson, to accompany him in his nap. It is a really intelligent game-help that I wanted to have available when my children were young, because it combines the usual combination of sounds and soft lights, also the movement of the tummy that swells and deflates, giving the impression of breathing together with the child. How many parents have noticed the calming effect of holding the children against their chest to calm them with the perception of their breath? Well, the otter does just that. The baby leans on this soft puppet, wanting to put a hand on us, perceives softness, warmth of the hair, movement of the breath and in addition the music chosen (from true melodies to more neutral sounds). Just regular first volume and sounds on the back, then the otter keeps company for thirty minutes. Very useful object and splendid gift idea.",Facebook,5,16-10-22,3,1

You turn on pressing the tummy, it works with batteries (4 batteries AA 1.5V already included in the package). In it we find the box battery holder, where you can choose one of the four functions of the game: music or relaxing sounds, you can distinguish the sounds of the maternal womb and also sounds of nature that help calm babies. You can feel the breath during sleep and combine the function that simulates a natural breath with the movement of the belly that goes up and down. You can also choose to associate a soft light (which would be the area of the button on the belly). In short, you can customize it as you want. And very nice thing that pushes me to give full of the votes, once removed the box of batteries, you can safely wash in a 30 °. Excellent solution!",Twitter,5,17-10-22,2,1
1331,B0019CW0HE,"This beautiful otter of Fisher-Price is a plush made especially for children, especially for newborns to help them sleep better, to calm them when they cry and not make them feel alone. The otter was made with a device inserted inside the body of the plush, a mechanism that can be removed by removing it from the back of the otter thanks to a good opening with the velcro, in this way it is also possible to wash the plush in the washing machine. The device has six buttons: - The first two serve to increase or decrease the volume of the music and sounds reproduced by the otter; - The third reproduces the music of some lullaby in rotation, and turns off automatically after thirty minutes; - The fourth reproduces the breath while sleeping, the sound of the wind, the heartbeat and the heartbeat when it is active in the womb, to switch from one type of sound to the other, it is enough to press the button: the first time will stop the sound and the second time will be activated by the sound; the fifth one can lift the breath to the next.",Instagram,5,10-11-22,1,1

I try in my reviews to be always impartial, but with products of this type ( turned to babies/children) I try to be even more picky precisely for the mission they have. We start immediately saying that the brand in this sense is a certainty, although many do not know that Fisher Price is totally part of the Mattel group since 1993 and that within a few hanni the company that controls it closed all the factories in the USA and transferred all the production in CINA. This small niche just to remind you that despite the very high standards and quality and maniac attention to details as well as the materials of the first order we are talking about the most beautiful products made in CHINA. Having said this, this small (to want to look at it well then much) pet is really addictive..I would say that all the soft plus is a soft feature of the very soft packing mechanism and picking it up with the power of the inside chamber, which I am able to clean up, but it creates an addiction!",Flipcart,5,20-03-20,,1

Fisher Price has really made center with this otter-shaped plush, represented in the most famous and sweet of his poses, intent to sleep blissfully on the back, with his paws on the chest. Very soft and cared for in every detail, we speak of a toy designed for babies, therefore I try dangerous parts. But the plus of this toy is that pressing the tummy lights up and the otter simulates the movement of the breathing, emitting sounds and music. It can be created the ideal combination for each child, selecting the type of sound/music, the furate and the volume. Inside there is the \cuore of the toy, or the feeding (it works with 4 batteries included) and the electronic unit that allows to make movements and sounds.

This new fisher price line has finally reproduced other types of animals because at the bottom there are not only bears, cats or dogs. In this case it is an otter. A sweet otter that will accompany your children during the nann, but not only. Thought obviously for the little ones does not exhaust but its works when the tannins grow. I tell you immediately that if I could give more than 5 stars to this puppet I would have given them, and now I tell us why: - the puppet is done well, adequate dimensions neither too big nor too small.. perfect for. the nannanna. Morbid even if it has a retro part of the electronics. I am delighted with the aesthetic that in the sounds that are not at all invadable. - does not simply have the function of the night light (which is also soft and does not disturbing) the power of the Lon. It is also funny to be able to breathed through the breathing. It is also in the same way of the music, and in the music, and in the music that it is not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be used in the movement of the movement of the sounds, and is not to be able to use it is not at all of the sounds are not at all things that it is not intru for anything invad. - it is not invad. - it is not at all - it is not simply the function of the function of night light (which is not too much invad.

It has a really relaxing and calming power, suitable for babies up to about 4/5 years of age, and what important, removing the electronic part, it is possible to wash the small otter in the washing machine!

The first is the adjustment of the sound level, The second is the choice of the ringtone, being of so many white noises that reconcile the sleep, including the heartbeat. The third is the on/off of the light on the tummy while the last function provides only the light without audio.

I can wash it in the washing machine (without the electric part). MY CONVINCE? Yes, it is a great gift idea for our children, who relax with the sweet breath of the puppet. Breath is the thing that has most affected me, in fact it seems to be real; an incredible effect. Also the puppet is very soft is well made, so even without using these effects remains a very tender object. If you want to save the box, we can use it as a cot for the small otter.

Once set to activate the plush will press the tummy and, for about 30 minutes, will continue with the program set.

It also produces rhythmic movements of the breath that help the child to calm down.

66,B001IUKD76,"I’m so torn with this “toy”. I want to love it but I’m not sure if I do, hence giving it a mid-range rating.
It’s super cute, but not overly cuddly for a bedtime toy due to the power pack inside. The breathing function is really cute but the mechanism that pushes the tummy in and out is noisy and my daughter (16 months old) learnt very quickly that she could force it downwards so I’ve had to turn it off.
The buttons being on the inside means that it’s difficult to adjust any of the settings while you’re laying there with a baby possibly (probably) laying on one arm while you try to get them to sleep. It has a super stiff/scratchy Fisher Price label sticking out of the side, which could’ve been made from silky material as this is a comfort toy.
And the last negative - it’s really overpriced for what it is. It should be £25 at most!
Positives - as said, it’s really cute. You can wash it. The lullabies, breathing and heartbeat noises are all soothing and lovely and my daughter does really like it - which was the aim of buying it, so I guess it’s doing its job :)",Flipcart,3,18-09-22,9,1

68,B0025VRCJY,Great quality and so cute! Really snuggly for my 4 month old granddaughter to fall asleep with and very proactive when she is awake. Soothing tune and comforting breathing motion. She loves it!,Facebook,5,28-01-20,1,1
84,B0025VRCJY,"I initially bought this for my 4month old son. I found it to be too big and heavy for him. I didn't' find the breathing mechanism helped at all for sleep. I ended up giving it to my 2.5-year-old who LOVED it.

What I like about it:
-Lighting - the otter emits a very soft, non-blue-light glow which I think is great and does not disrupt sleep.
-Battery life - I purchased this 3 months ago and I've had to replace the batteries once, and it is used nightly.
-very soft and cute washes well and still looks new.
-The older child loves it.

Drawbacks:
-I agree with previous reviewers that the breathing mechanism is quite loud. I can hear it from across the hallway when my daughter engages the button in the night. She doesn't seem to mind.
-While it's cute, I find it too large for younger babies, and even potentially dangerous for them in a crib. It's about the size of a cabbage patch doll.
-The settings are on the inside of the otter - so if you need to or want to change volume settings, you have to do so before the baby is in bed, or you might wake up the baby with the strong velcro closure.
- I also had a hard time getting the right settings working - it seems to be in demo mode at times...
-Small children can open the velcro on the back and pull out the light and breathing mechanism box. My daughter does this in the night sometimes and uses the inside mechanism as a flashlight. It's safe, but still annoying to have her remove it constantly, then ask me to put it back inside.

Overall, I think this is better suited to older babies or toddlers. My toddler's sleep has improved generally since this otter was introduced - she likes to take care of the otter and is comforted by the gentle glow and sweet songs.",Twitter,4,28-05-20,7,1
100,B0025VRCJY,"I am very unhappy with this product, which is surprising since I am a huge Fisher-Price fan. I think I must have received a defective item because the breathing and movement options only stay on for about 3 seconds. I have tried replacing batteries but that did not help. The music stays on long-term, but I got it for the breathing and sounds. I would return the item however my husband disposed of all packaging materials before I had a chance to use it. Extremely disappointed and a waste of $40.",Instagram,1,12-02-20,2,1
104,B0025VRCJY,"Amazing. Within 2 weeks of using this, my baby started sleeping by herself. She used to cry as soon as you put her down. The breathing and noise option work wonders. She loves it. The only bad thing is the button to turn it on is right on the front, so I have to turn it away from her or she'll turn it off",Flipcart,5,05-02-20,4,0
130,B0025VRCJY,"I bought this for my little guy when he started his 8 month sleep regression. It was a bit of a long shot but I was desperate! Wow, it really helped! He seems to find it really soothing. I put on the white noise function and the tummy rising/falling, which he loves. 2 months later and it’s an integral part of his bedtime routine! The light is very soft, not a disturbance at all. Highly recommend.",Amazon,5,24-11-20,1,1

The only thing I dont love is when you have the belly function on it make sort of a robotic noise and if baby is holding it tightly it makes a clicking noise as it tries to move.

1319,B007JFV6RK,"The button to activate this is on the otter's tummy and very sensitive.  So, if my upset baby activates it, it turns itself off IMMEDIATELY at the first ""breath"" it takes because the tummy expands and presses the button against the cuddling baby.  If I turn it on and keep it away from him, it's a miracle. But he can never touch it or go near it or it will turn off IMMEDIATELY.  I have to watch these cry/calm/cry/calm dramas over the baby monitor and it's infuriating.  The Fisher Price ""Snug a puppy"" stays on for 15 minutes once pressed.  I thought it was annoying at first, ""Why can't I turn this thing off!?"" But now I get it.  This thing could be revolutionary but it amounts to junk because the very sensitive button is smack dab in the center of the glowing and moving tummy which, of course, is where any baby or toddler will want to touch and cuddle immediately.  Please make a new version that stays on!!!!!! And contact me or send it to me!!!!!!!! This thing is amazing when I play ""keep away"" with it but totally impossible to use for the purpose of self soothing.  Just mom initiated and overseen soothing. Not good for babies who can move on their own.",Flipcart,2,01-10-22,69,1
1379,B007JFV6RK,"Attention: Could contain traces of German translation and self-mockery.

Oh my god. This is the cutest soother of my toy collection. And it is huge!
I'm a German toy collector and allthough I'm blind I immedeately fell in love with this otter. YouTube and technology makes it possible. I just had to have it! Unfortunately it didn't last long. To tell you the truth... Not even a year later and the motor is wornout so strong that it sounds like a mixture of a chainsaw and a drone. Not really soothing. And no joke, I couldn't find it anywhere online or in stores. But here!
The otter arrived earlier as planned and now it is guarded like the apple of my eye.
And yes I know that I'm actually a grown woman... But hey, think positive. It doesn't just help babies drifting off to dreamland. Anyway, I have to leave and sit myself in the garden to enjoy this calming music again. And again. And again. And... *snore*

1380,B007JFV6RK,"To be honest I don't get all the excitement about this fuzz ball. I personally think its waaaay overpriced for the few functions that it has! A very good substitute toy for this one is an elephant which has star projector/music/heart beat from Walmart for $15, I got as baby shower gift which is much more on demand than this toy. I only like the music verity, its very soft and beautiful, but I hate that it has the light that you can't jut switch off, it turns on w/ music. Or you can't disable to ""breathing"". There is a very stiff mechanical device inside the body so you gotta watch this toy dropping on the floor. Would have returned it immediately if we haven't recycled the packaging box. We opened allot of baby toys that day and all the wrapping was placed in trash can. I ended up just re-gifting this toy to another person as is who had triplets.",Facebook,2,02-01-20,16,1
1381,B001L4ELRW,"I don't normally write reviews, but for this I will. Its cute, very soft. The night light and music is great. But the motor in it that makes it appear to be ""breathing"" which is the soothe factor for babies, honestly its pretty noisy....for $40. Kind of has a annoying hum to it. I think if you're going to pay 40$ for something like this it should be dead silent. Furthermore when I turned it on, it squeaked every time the belly went up, it was annoying. I actually took it apart, opened up the electronic box and found that the up and down part of the mechanism, is operated by a motorized wheel and and a tiny rubber belt. Not kidding, I WD-40'd that rubber belt. It took 2 hours to carefully put it all back together. It has to line up perfectly for the moving parts to work perfectly. There is no more squeak, thank god. The motor still has a quiet hum to it. Honestly my kid likes to turn it on an off and could care less to cuddle it. More so its a 40$ otter that entertains her and holds her pacifiers for her at night. Nice idea, but kinda overpriced.",Twitter,3,14-02-20,11,0
1382,B003SO503C,This little cutie is super soft and has a lot of functions. I thought it would be a hard toy since it does the fake breathing and would feel more like a robot toy but it’s actually soft and airy. The breathing sound and womb sounds are my babies favorite so far. I would definitely recommend this !,Amazon,5,02-06-22,19,0
1383,B003SO503C,"So, I saw this and then decided to buy it.  This toy soothes your newborn, and sometimes it provides the feeling of someone sleeping next to me baby, it plays music, has a heartbeat feature and it has this little fan!  My newborn likes or does not know it exists all I know is that he sleeps good and longer with it.  Not bad for the money",Instagram,5,08-06-22,11,1
1384,B003ZFXJDW,Our newborn loves this otter; she watches it until she falls asleep and if we don’t turn it on she will make a sound to let us know she wants it on. She has slept great with this otter; she prefers the white noise option with the light and breathing motion. I would recommend this soother to anyone!

1385,B003ZFXJDW,"I wanted to love this but it’s too much maintenance to utilize. Definitely something parents can wait to buy when the baby is 8 months or older. I wish I didn’t have to open the back of the sloth every time I want to utilize everything the sloth does. I would also like it to be more stuffed/squishy to hold, it fall short on the cuddling factor. The box inside in huge and obviously hard. The sound and vibration has good payoff but user friendly it’s not unless you’re content just pushing the tummy to do 1 thing versus going to the back and opening it up over and over to utilize everything it can do. Btw the back opening is made of velcro. I think it’s over priced for the payoff factor of enjoyment that  is lacking with this toy to sooth a baby or toddler.",Amazon,3,18-10-20,2,1
1386,B003ZFXJDW,"I purchased this late one sleepless night while I tried to get her sleep on her own in her bed. She didn't take to it until she was about 8 months old, but now it's MUST HAVE. She loves it. She'll gently touched the ""breathing"" stomach and lay there watching the glowing fade in and out. She likes the music best. What I love; all the options. There's heartbeat, swooshing sounds, music and you can control the loudness too. You could have no light on or no breathing if you wanted. It's fantastic. The only complaint I have is that if she pushes on the tummy or cuddles it too hard, it turns off. So, until she learns to push it back on...well, that's up to Mommy and Daddy. Overall though; highly recommend.",Flipcart,5,08-01-21,2,0
1387,B001HTL6CY,"I was recommended to buy this by a family member who had purchased it for her kids.

Prior to purchasing I did read some concerning reviews and was a little skeptical as it’s pretty pricey but wanted to give it a chance. The toy is extremely soft and easy to set up to use. The functions allow you to choose music, a light which you can dim or brighten and breathing function. We used this combo for my 1 yr old and she would fall asleep watching it.

Less than a month later sadly I have to return it as the belly doesn’t move up and down for more than 10 seconds it’s also cuts off the music and light before I even leave her room. Pressing the belly back in I can hear a loud clicking sound that wasn’t there when initially turning it on.

For the money especially, I couldn’t understand why this child’s sleeping lovey was not in the least bit “snuggly” advertised.",Twitter,3,08-07-20,,0
1413,B002MV23XM,I love the little otter...worked well to help baby sleep but after 4 months with minimal use the belly stopped working and the music would play for about 2 seconds and shut off. I love the music though and it will still play by pressing the play button in the back.,Amazon,4,09-04-20,,0
1414,B000LKZK7C,I bought this as a baby present.  I had to play with it a little before I gave it away though. It's so soft.  And such a cute little otter.  The music is soft and comforting. The button in the tummy lights up with a soft glow. And it breathes!  Such a cute concept!,Instagram,5,24-10-20,,1
1415,B000LKZK7C,I’ve been eyeing this soother since I got the notification that Fischer price was making it. My little one loves it so much! Only downside is that the settings are easily changed through the fabric in the back. Still adorable though!,Flipcart,4,02-01-20,1,1
1416,B000LKZK7C,"Excellent quality baby soother. It’s soft and light, just the right size snuggle buddy for my 4 month old. The volume is perfect, not too loud, and the quality of sound is smooth and soothing. I just love it. It’s so cute, and it does it’s job well.",Amazon,5,28-12-20,,1
1417,B000LKZK7C,My 10 month old really started fighting bedtime recently. I decided to get this over the glow warm or bs soothing animals and I'm glad I did! This does so much and you can control what is played as well as the volume.. It runs for a good amount of time too. It's helped me and my little guy when its comes to bedtime. Has even put my boyfriend to sleep. We love this adorable little sea otter! Id completely recommend this!!,Flipcart,5,28-09-20,,1
1418,B000LKZK7C,This otter really does breath! Its a little hard but overall quality is great. The music it plays is soothing and plays for a long time so you don't have to get up every five minutes to turn it back on! It has a little glow light on its belly and my 9 month old seems to love it! Definitely too big for a newborn- 6 month old but worth it to sleep train your baby!,Amazon,5,16-09-20,,1
1419,B000LKZK7C,"I was wondering if it can soothe my baby girl's tension before sleep, so I play the music and found my baby fall asleep quickly when hearing the music. The volume can be adjusted easily and I can switch o white noise mode from the buttons on the otter's back. Although the price is kind of higher than my budget, it works great and is so cute that my baby and I feel joyful when the otter is playing music.",Facebook,5,24-12-20,,1
1420,B000LKZK7C,"Honestly I returned this. The reviews were great but for 40 bucks, this is like any other toy that makes sounds to my baby. It didn’t phase him and like what other reviewers said, if you lightly touch the stomach it stops playing music and stuff so it just sat next to him... eh",Twitter,2,14-02-20,,1

1423,B000LKZK7C,After our sons last sleep buddy gave out on us I searched for something similar and this is the closest I found. He seems to enjoy it. It definitely has a mechanical sound when the breathing feature is engaged but it doesn’t bother us at all.,Amazon,5,17-12-22,,1
1424,B000LKZK7C,"I got this for my 2 mo old niece, she loves it so much that my sister and her husband have already had to replace the batteries.

1426,B000LKZK7C,"I am so disappointed in this. I had it on my registry and loved how cute it looked. The sound functions are ok, but the breathing motion is not as expected.

1526,B002O3VHXU,"This is charming.  We all love this toy.  The otter is so cute, and the breathing is adorable.  There’s a little mechanical sound I don’t like.  There are four sounds the otter makes, including something that is supposed to sound like when baby was still in the uterus, but no ocean, which is our favorite on the Sleep Sheep.One major concern, however, is the otter’s arms,  my 3yo demonstrates how they can act as handcuffs for a young child and - even though I can’t say for certain that this would be problematic - it strikes me as potentially dangerous.  So buyer beware...",Flipcart,4,09-06-22,14,1
1527,B002O3VHXU,"At first I was hesitant about getting this because I thought it was weird and creepy but after seeing other reviews and hearing from people who swear by it I decided to give it a chance. I’m so glad I did! It’s surprisingly very soft and cuddly even with the big electronic contraption inside. It’s so convenient that I can just take the electronics out and throw it in the wash and it comes out just as soft as before. I love the colors and the little fish detail fabric on the tail, super cute. The belly movement is still a little off putting to me but it really did soothe our newborn. I appreciate all the different sound options and that the belly can be a little night light. We don’t use this every time baby sleeps because we don’t want our little one becoming dependent on something but every now and then when we do use it for calming baby it’s been a life saver. It makes for a great on-the-go noise machine as well for our trips to grandmas house. We call ours Otto :)",Amazon,5,04-07-22,11,1
1528,B002O3VHXU,"The Fisher Price Soothe n Snuggle Otter is absolutely adorable! This little guy is a welcome addition in our home.
The material is plush and incredibly soft. Press the belly and it plays classic lullabies like twinkle, twinkle little star plus other soothing music that is sure to calm and relax your little one. His belly glows through a seashell shaped piece while the abdomen area rises and falls gently as if he's really breathing.
All the different features are easily accessible through velcro pieces on his back. The buttons are all conveniently labeled with little pictures so you won't have any problems adjusting the volume up and down or turning off the glowing light feature. I really like how you're able to customize the features to whatever your baby prefers. For example, you can have the music playing but disable the light and breathing features OR have the lights on with the music but shut off the moving belly.
One of the first things I noticed was how heavy this toy is. Not heavy for an adult but my 18 month old can just barely hold it up. The weight is the result of the gigantic battery which fills up most of the inside. While the outside material is cozy and soft, the huge rectangular shaped battery makes it awkward to cuddle. I can't imagine any child snuggling up with this comfortably since it would be like lying with a plush covered brick.
My daughter (who is 18 months old) was not initially impressed with the otter. She hardly even glanced at it. I ended up putting it beside her diaper changing area and the soothing lights and sounds are now a wonderful distraction when I need her to be still. This also would have been a great toy to have when she was an inconsolable infant. I think babies under one are far more likely to enjoy this toy, compared to older toddlers who may get bored easily.
High quality, just like most Fisher Price toys but I'm giving 4 stars because I wouldn't describe this as snuggly.",Flipcart,4,27-06-22,2,1
1529,B0057FTBYO,"First off-- this is seriously the most adorable little thing I've ever seen! It's also so, so soft and cuddly. I would be lying if I said that I didn't think of testing it out myself before giving it to my daughter. Outside of the apparent aesthetic appeal (who can deny the cuteness of an otter) of this little otter the features are amazing. With the breathing motion of the otter (tummy rising and falling) I thought that it may feel too mechanical, however, that was not the case. I love the fact that you can utilize lights, sound, and motion and customize based on what features best work with your kiddo. Win here: you can remove the mechanical piece to throw the otter body into the washing machine!

This would make a great gift for a baby shower or for a new parent!

UPDATE: now that my daughter has had this for awhile, I can happily say she loves her otter! It is in bed with her every single night. In the morning before she is fully awake I have caught her pressing the tummy to turn on the sound and lights and laying by her new little friend calmly. Definitely a win!!",Amazon,5,01-07-22,2,1
1530,B0087HW5E2,"This little thing is *such* a great gift for expecting moms. It's sizeable enough that it won't get lost, it's soft and fuzzy, and the heartbeat is lovely. Honestly, my 13-year-old wanted to keep it forever and ever, and was super disappointed when I said we were giving it to a friend. However, said friend is a close one, so she gets to play with it regularly anyway. ;) The batteries last a reasonable amount of time, the sound isn't *too* loud, and it really is comforting. Because it lays flat, it can be put either in the crib, or on a shelf right above it with no issues. The light isn't super bright, either, but it's just enough that in the darkness of the room, you have a pleasant glow that won't KILL your eyeballs if you walk in from another dark room in the middle of the night.Overall, this really was a great gift, and if I knew anyone having a little one, I'd be happy to give this again!",Facebook,5,12-05-20,,1

It is so cute, super soft and just the right size for an infant.My daughter still has minor Colic and ever since I got this toy for her she has been falling asleep, and staying asleep much quicker and longer. The breathing feature along with the heartbeat sound gives her just enough comfort to doze off without everyone constantly having to hold her.The lullabies keep her dozed off and the little comfort light lets me know how everything is going. I wish I would have had this toy months ago. This will be my new go-to shower gift!",Twitter,5,11-07-22,3,1
1532,B003YXWAF8,"My infant son won't sleep without me near. I wanted something that might help him fall asleep without me. This cute and soft otter is just what I was looking for. I love that this has the rising and falling chest feature. It's the perfect thing to make him feel like he's falling asleep with me. This also features soft, pleasant music or white noise or snoring. It's really nice that you can choose which option you prefer as well as have control over how loud or soft the sounds are. My only complaint is that all of the 'noise' options seem to last longer than just the simple rise and fall and I'd rather my son not get used to having sounds in order to fall asleep. That one complaint aside, I also love that this is machine washable when you pull the remote out of the back. And amazingly, I find my older kids enjoying sitting and holding this otter too.",Amazon,4,22-06-22,1,1

1534,B003YXWAF8,I was very surprised when we received this to see that the otter breathes just like it would in real life while it is playing music or one of the sounds that it plays.  My daughter loves sleeping with this in her pack n play and feeling it takes breaths and the music is the perfect volume so it isn't too loud or soft and it helps to soothe her to sleep.  It also has a little light in it's stomach which is great too because it is very soft and not meant to wake up your little one.  I am so very happy with this toy and so is my daughter.  Great item to have to help your little one sleep in their own safe space and still think that  someone is next to them.,Flipcart,5,05-07-22,1,1
1535,B003YXWAF8,"My LO LOVES this little otter. She cuddles up with it and squeezes it. She seems to be soothed by the sounds and the breathing motion. I was nervous she might have found this scary, because something things that move make her cry, but this guy didn't! My LO just turned a year, and I can foresee her using this for at least another year, if not longer!",Amazon,5,10-07-22,1,1
1536,B003YXWAF8,"This is a nice soothing sound machine/stuffed animal. There are buttons inside the back under the velcro. The options are for its ""breathing"" motion, a light on its tummy, music, or sound. After you make the selection you simply press its stomach and it will do them all, but for each a separate amount of time. It will do 30 minutes of music/ sounds, 10 minutes of breathing motion,  and 15 minutes of the light. The nice thing about this is the otter is machine washable, you just take the electronic unit out.",Flipcart,5,06-07-22,,1
1537,B000UXA3L8,"My first impression was that it didn't really look like the picture and that something looked wrong with it.  When it started breathing, that was all I needed.  It's just too creepy for me.  The kids don't seem to care, but it's not something I would pick up and say ""cute"".",Amazon,3,19-06-22,2,1
1538,B000UXA3L8,"I just might have slept with it (since my husband doesn’t allow live pets in our bed). But she loves it and I’m teaching her that she can only have it at bedtime. That way she has something she loves to help her sleep. And help her it does! When she’s tired, all it takes is about five minutes of her listening or feeling the otter breathe and she’s asleep. This comes highly recommended!",Facebook,5,22-06-22,1,0
1539,B004AVYUOW,"My LO has had trouble sleeping in his own crip since he was born , I never thought I would be able to transition him easily . However this otter is the perfect transitioning tool . He watched his belly move up and down as he falls asleep and stays asleep all night . I highly recommend this !",Twitter,5,29-07-22,,1
1540,B001ESOQAM,Oh my this is simply adorable.  It simulates soft noises like baby would hear in the womb.  The animal breathes deeply and his tummy rises and falls while he’s deep asleep and you hear the sweet noises.  Soothes baby.  Wonderful shower present.,Instagram,5,14-07-22,,1
1541,B001ESOQAM,"Although this was larger than expected, this little snuggle buddy is amazing!! This soothes my baby so well. The belly “breathing” is amazingly soothing for my newborn.

75,B003XT4AV0,"It is a very practical toy, my baby is almost three months old and it is ideal for you not to feel alone in the crib when we lay her down.The stick that it has is that it lasts half an hour and that to change from melody to sounds you have to open a Velcro that is in the back and that makes a lot of noise and the baby wakes up.",Facebook,3,26-12-22,35,1

93,B001FA1MCO,"Above all I liked how smooth it is and the fact that it can be separated from the washing device (unbelievable error but today there are still toys for babies that cannot be washed...) so a great point in their favor, and more in the situation we are living... (you fall in the street and if you can not wash maybe you think until you throw it away... :-SThe device is like a controller (you can see it in the photos), you have options for almost everything! A pity is true, I have read in other comments that asked to record the voice and no, it does not include that option, although for my part I do not consider it essential.In general I am very happy with the otter, the only defect I see it is that the babies take everything to the face and the Velcro that closes the back is very rough and rigid, I think that another type of Velcro or a zipper would have been better option. Still I recommend it, I am sure that even if it stops working, it will remain one of their favorite stuffed animals :)",Instagram,5,16-10-20,4,1
96,B001FA1MCO,"It turns on by pressing the belly, but to turn it off you have to open the Velcro from behind and press two buttons at the same time, which is somewhat uncomfortable.Although if you press the gut it also ends up turning off, but in the instructions indicate that the way to turn it off is in the back buttons, so I don't know if it will spoil it in the gut.The movement of the breath makes quite noise.However, the doll is very sweet and with the light low or off it is very relaxing.The sounds are very good and you can regulate the volume.",Flipcart,4,05-12-22,5,1
97,B001ELL6O8,"Spectacular! Our baby of almost 8 months, who has always had a hard time falling asleep, loves and relaxes so much!!! The sound of breathing is the one we like the most, along with the light and movement of tummy. It has become an essential for the time to go to sleep!",Amazon,5,27-07-22,7,1
98,B001ELL6O8,"We bought it for our 4-month-old baby, who has a hard time falling asleep, and we only get him to do it on the chest in bed, and the truth is that he has not listened to it, nor does it happen to sleep, nor to play, it strikes him zero. The toy itself meets all the features it announces, it is adorable, warm and soft, but in our case, it does not fulfill its purpose of relaxing and sleeping the baby.",Flipcart,3,26-11-22,6,1
103,B001ELL6O8,"My daughter is delighted and at last it seems that we get her to sleep alone with her otter friend! She is two years old.The teddy is very soft, the musics are nice and in a short tone, perfect to help relax (to me relax, hahahaha).She has a light also soft, that is enough to not stay in the dark, but she doesn't see much to get out of bed.The tummy makes a move to go up and down that definitely hypnotizes and that also helps her relax!It has been a successful purchase!At first it seemed a little expensive, but we like it very much and, the main thing, is helping the little girl fall asleep alone! :)",Amazon,5,13-07-20,2,0
110,B001ELL6O8,The best gift we could give our baby. Until three months he suffered from colic and has been his cot to date. He sleeps caressing him. At night we put the melody together with The Light of the tripita that goes up and down and sometimes the function of the heartbeat I think it will be his teddy for years.Like everything is improveable; the manufacturer would suggest that the engine (inside the teddy) of all functions be reduced and so the teddy was soft and manageable. I fear that as soon as the baby grows and can manipulate it we will have to remove it because it is very heavy and in that case we will fill it with foam but our BEBE is FELIZ with its otter so highly recommended as a gift,Facebook,5,30-03-20,2,1
131,B001ELL6O8,"It is beautiful, soft and original, with the tummy that lights up and goes up and down as if breathing.

154,B001ELL6O8,"The product is good for my son who is not even two months old, it usually costs him to sleep and I thought about this stuffed animal, because it has colic and with the sound of the heart it falls asleep. Since it must remind him when it was inside me and with the music it relaxes. The only drawback is that to change it you have to open it and it makes noise I leave it open so you don't have to move it much. Otherwise it is fine, he still doesn't realize what it is but I hope that then he plays with it.Now that I have tried it a few days the batteries don't last anything...",Amazon,5,08-12-20,,1

I recommend the seller, has responded very quickly.",Amazon,5,23-05-20,,1

1315,B000G6RYNE,"Tell you that this teddy is designed for babies up to about 2 or 3 months, I tell you this because the device that controls the sound control unit is in the back and only prevents access to that place a velkro, so it is not ideal for babies who already use their hands effectively. But on the contrary for babies that mobility is scarce is a very good teddy, since the sounds that they produce can calm the baby, highlighting the sound of the mother’s heart, is really achieved. The teddy is soft, detachable, and at the same time can be washed without any problem. Mattel’s teddyney is ideal to place it in the crib and calm the little one, so that his rest is excellent. Of course say that the teddy bear is a nurse that is asleep. My experience with this product has been positive.",Twitter,4,17-08-22,8,1

After 10 minutes where he was fighting against himself because he did not want to sleep, he had lost the fight, heh.. and in the evening he blabs briefly but sleeps in 10 minutes.

It has a timer of 30 minutes and you can control the volume, something that is very appreciated in these toys, since not all can control the volume and in some cases it is very high.

The presentation is also very pretty, since the box simulates a cunita. • It is completely unisex. • It is very colorful for gift, since the teddy comes to the eye and can even be tested, since it has demonstration stacks on it. In our case the whole set comes protected with a transparent plastic bag so that it does not get dirty before it is released. • The fabric is very soft and pleasant. • We love that you can very easily separate the teddyney from the mechanism to be able to wash it in the washing machine. All the interactive stuffed animals should be like this! • Pressing the tripita, it lights up and puffs up as if you breathe, calmly and paused. The effect is very accomplished. • We can select very soft music (nanas), sounds of nature and white noise (beats, whispers...). It automatically turns off after 30 minutes. • We can choose the intensity of our light and volume of the music and sounds. • We do not even make us look very good.",Facebook,4,12-08-22,1,1
1334,B000G6RYNE,"Today almost for any medium quality teddy, we pay what is worth this teddy that even more, the touch of the skin is very soft, it is seen that they have taken into account that it is for babies, because you do not expect me neither the seams that simulate the eyes neither the mouth nor the nose, you have certain parts in cloth how they can be the soles of the feet to the bottom of the tail, but the seams are well done that is not appreciated, the sound is a tone that does not turn out strident, there is a feeling of relaxation, besides the dim light that comes out of the navel, does the times of light for fear of the darkness, we have tried it with a baby that is barely 2 months old, when you put your brother and one of teddyney next, has been curious, when we have activated it we have not noticed any kind of fear, and soon they were both lying next to each other, the truth is that seeing the result is worth the price that is worth it.",Twitter,5,12-08-22,1,1

It is of a very soft touch, it is washable both by hand and machine, the size is the right, it is unisex is valid for boy or girl, we can take the electronic part of the part that is not without problems, the batteries carry their safety screws that will make our children unable to pull them out.

It has different types of music and relaxing sounds that we can choose together with the lights and the movement of the belly, the going up and down of this next to the noise that mimics the breath are very accomplished. All this can be selected by means of buttons hidden in the back by means of Velcro. It works by means of 4 AA batteries. On the other hand, the mechanism is easily removed so that we can wash the part of the cloth.In addition, if we want to give it away, the presentation is careful because the otter is lying in a box that simulates a crib and remains very cute.",Flipcart,5,22-08-22,1,1
1338,B000G6RYNE,"Hi friends  amazon. When you click the otter print of the belly you light a warm yellow light and your belly goes up and down, It sounds a piano-like muse with some variations that are changed from the electronic unit that is inside the otter. I had to open it from behind to get to the unit and there you find all its control buttons, Volume Control, Music, Light and Heart Beats. It works with 4 batteries of the type AA/LR6. It is somewhat messy to be opening the otter whenever you want to change music or the rest of its parameters, I would have preferred a remote control or that its buttons were on the outside. That of opening the otter whenever I want to change something bores me a little. The otter is great, but its electronic unit ends boring you with time.",Amazon,4,14-08-22,1,1

The effect ""breathing"" is very good because while vibrating, the teddy goes ""inchanting"" the belly, creating a sensation that the little one finds pleasant and relaxing. The volume is adjustable as well as whether or not to turn on the little lights and/or to turn on or not the effect ""breathing"". A very soft ""companion"" of naps for our little ones. The price seems high, but if we compare with others of worse quality and similar price is resolved the question of whether it is expensive or not :) A product highly recommended, the little one will love.",Flipcart,5,10-08-22,1,1
1344,B000G6RYNE,"One of the biggest problems that we have when it comes to sleeping a baby is to calm down for it, and one of the best solutions is music, and if it goes with a soft teddy and it mimics human breathing, then much better, and that's what we have in this teddy in the form of an otter, it's very soft so it doesn't damage the baby's skin, it has music that relaxes it, and it works by imitating the breathing, so it's especially thought for babies since its birth. The teddyney is small and has up to eleven sensory functions, in this way, besides relaxing the baby, it helps him to move more and better, it helps him to develop the view and the touch, and especially with the ears, it has the possibility to program up to thirty minutes of music and in the area of the belly it carries a small soft light to entertain the baby more. It works perfectly, relax the baby and we are calmer, it has a very good price and it is of great quality, so I do advise it.",Amazon,4,21-02-20,,1

It is an ideal teddy for newborn babies as it performs breathing movements that will help babies to learn, as well as to relax. Thanks to this teddy the little ones will be able to encourage both the sight, the ear and the touch. We will be able to customize the music we want, as well as the light intensity up to 30 minutes. The teddy fabric is very soft and has no small pieces so without any doubt it is an excellent gift for any baby who has just been born. The current price is around 40 euros, given the brand, the quality and the polyvalence it seems a really recommendable purchase.

It has several buttons in the back to control the level of volume, light, and the options of melodies, sounds (beats, nature, breathing) and the mechanism of breathing of the tripita, this last point in my case is giving me problems, you listen a lot the motor (thing that is not relaxing anything) in the video I have put the melody to the low volume so that the noise that makes is heard, on the other side I stop working the motor and at the time it works again but it seems that it jumps the breath and makes a small noise when I jump, if it happens to you it can also happen that it is a bad part of series and not an isolated defect, in any case you will not have problem in Amazon to solve it quickly.

It seems to me a very sweet toy, you squeeze his belly and it starts to sound a very soft and pleasant music, in addition to a small light that is lit in his navel and, best of all, the doll starts to breathe, and that relaxes a lot. Besides, the noise of the mechanism looks like the purling of a kitten. It is an ideal doll to give to a newborn, although I think it can use any child a little older at bedtime, because it accompanies, and many times they are afraid of the darkness. The presentation has very much liked, the box imitates a cunita in which is the nurse sleeping belly up.",Facebook,5,19-08-22,,1

It is not magic art, but it is true that it encourages its rest and with it ours. Musical tones its can regular and it is totally serene, nothing excessive. Recommended, it is certainly something expensive to be a teddyney but it is worth trying if the baby gives bad nights. If it solves it or reduces it for little it will have been worth it.

Now, what I found more beautiful is that the belly of the otter makes a move as if it were breathing, it is adorable!

69,B000G6RYNE,"Update: After half a year, the engine in the belly has slowed down. The weak buzzing from the beginning is now as loud as a mix of toy drone and model plane and drowns out the quietest volume level. Very unpleasant. Fortunately, I quickly found a replacement (at the time it was sold out almost everywhere...) and because brains are a funny thing, my now needs both otters to fall asleep. One to Anguck (or scare someone with knatterknatterbrumbum) and one to be cute and fall asleep. And jaaaa, strictly speaking, I'm out of age. But only quite, strictly speaking... the functions of the otter are quickly explained. He plays music, lights up and lifts and lowers his belly, which is supposed to hug so half realisticly your and my breathing. Overall, he plays eight tunes (I believe?). Many of them I don't know and were probably produced by FP itself, the others are my bonny lies over the ocean, Mary a little lamb, beautiful can relax and twin know how to beat the other songs. If you don't do not want to play.",Instagram,4,23-08-22,105,1
70,B000G6RYNE,"So our son got his otter with 5.5 months and immediately grinned. He gets him during the day as a sleepmate and then draws him affectionately towards himself. Although it was still quite difficult for him he also lifted up to cuddle with him. Of course it is dangerous to let him sleep with it unattended at the age (danger of suddenly child death). But this is well known for all cuddly animals, blankets and pillows. The music is now after a month still not annoying but still really sweet. However, breathing is a tick too loud for me, but does not bother at all when falling asleep because it is regular. I just don't find it nice. The staggered switch it off I find great: first breathing, then light, then music. Also, that the volume can be regulated is great, because it is quite meh on his head. Many toys for babies are dangerously loud. Here no longer. In fact, he does not get any more at night (we had it taken away after falling asleep anyway). First, because he doesn't sleep with it again.",Flipcart,5,27-01-20,71,1

78,B000G6RYNE,The delivery was fast and it is easy to use as we have seen batteries can be changed quickly and easily.Our son is now 6 weeks old we always had difficulty getting him to sleep. We got the stuffed animal in the morning and tried out at noon and are thrilled!!! After 10 min where he himself was fighting because he did not want to sleep he had lost the fight and also in the evening he blabs briefly but fell asleep within 10 min,Amazon,5,02-08-22,25,1
79,B000G6RYNE,"The otter is really very sweet and fluffy. We always use it in the evening as part of our sleeping ritual, with the aim to fall asleep at some point without breastfeeding. My son is now 7 months and likes to cuddle with him. The volume control is very good, the melodies very pleasant. We currently use mainly the sound as in the womb.",Facebook,5,28-08-22,25,1
80,B000G6RYNE,"We've already tested some musical clocks, this is in our opinion the best!!! Very many functions, the volume is super good to regulate, pleasant sounds and melodies. It is not necessary to pull up with a band but the otter is activated by pressing on the belly. We bought 2 for both children and are enthusiastic. Absolute purchase recommendation!",Twitter,5,28-08-22,24,1
81,B000G6RYNE,We have a similar cuddly friend of the much more expensive variant. I have to say that our otter is simply awesome. Clean soothing tones. Even the mama sleeps well with it. Moving the belly up and down is fascinating and soothing too alike. The weak light in the belly of the otter is wonderful. All in all a great invention of Fisher Price and highly recommended.,Instagram,5,16-09-22,20,1
83,B000G6RYNE,"As has been mentioned before, the frame in which the engine is in is not reasonably padded, so that you can feel the hard edges. I find it impractical that you can only make adjustments when you open the back part. It might be more practical if you press at the foot or at the ear to handle certain sounds. I find, like some others, that the engine works far too loudly, so that it overtones the sounds and completely irritates them. In the technical development of today it is certainly possible to develop a better engine performance. I expected more from Fisher-Price for the price.",Flipcart,3,05-12-22,9,1
87,B000G6RYNE,"The otter looks very cute, the little night light on his belly is practical for the night and as a music box I find it not bad, because the melodies are very nice and soothing.However, I bought it first of all, because I thought that these breathing noises and lifting and lowering of the belly could be calming and helping to fall asleep.My child (6 months) first laughed and then she found it kind of stupid.The engine is very loud, because you don't hear the rest of the noises well anymore, unless you set the volume relatively high. My personal opinion is that this part is not so helpful in ""sleep problems"".",Amazon,2,11-11-22,9,0

95,B000G6RYNE,"The melodies are very soothing and not as intrusive as with other products. Also the light and the snoring function of the otter are quite pleasant.However, there are also some negative points: As a cuddly animal, for example, the otter is not suitable at all and it is a mystery to me how in some reviews the talk of ""cuddly"" can be.The fabric is soft, however, the inner life of the stuffed animal is so huge and hard that it really can't be cuddly.The huge Velcro fastener on the back of the otter is also very disturbing and can be opened very quickly.In addition, the motor of the breathing function is so loud and annoying that it is not used in us at all. Therefore only 3 stars for this sloping aid.",Amazon,3,22-08-20,3,1
99,B000G6RYNE,"I got the otter at the beginning of January for my daughter, who was 1 month old at that time, now she is 10 months old. She was a writer and only let herself be calmed by white noise. At the beginning I was not so excited about the otter because he was too quiet for my daughter, he did not come to scream against her - we had to use a cell phone app. Since she is about 4 months old, however, the otter is in permanent use. We always use the functions noise and light. Every time she wakes up at night, I turn on him, the very small light source helps me to quiet (sleep in the family bed and silently lying down). And it helps her to fall asleep again. She wakes up very often in the night, sometimes every 30-60 minutes, so the otter is in some nights in the ""dauerbeinsatz"" of the only manko: The otter runs exactly 30 minutes, but then goes out. And exactly at the moment she wakes up because the noise stopped and at the time in the sleep cycle she has arrived again at light sleep. Therefore she doesn't always wait until she wake up the Otter.",Facebook,5,15-10-20,2,0
101,B000G6RYNE,"Since we have been looking for a great music box for a long time and overwhelmed the positive reviews, I also ordered the Otter. When this came on, we had to find out that the supplied batteries were empty. If you don't have any in the house then you can't even test it... That was the first minus point. The second and then I have to connect to the negative reviews that the engine is simply too loud when lifting the belly and lowering it. It's also a disturbing noise. Also the ""white noise"", which is supposed to represent the bloodstream in the womb, sounds rather like a radio station that has no reception. For me personally it doesn't seem calming and my child does not have a calmer effect, rather the opposite was the result. The other sounds, such as heart tones and CTG, are not bad, but for us not useful, as we had to find out. The third minus point goes to the sound/leiser controller. Of course, if it's about minutes, but I think that it's even quieter. My opinion is not too cute, but it's also nice to say it's quiet in the big room.",Twitter,3,08-12-22,2,1

The little animal arrived quickly, as usual from Amazon. Unpacked and tested... The various functions are absolutely sufficient to bring a small child AND an adult to sleep. The function that the belly moves and light breath sounds are generated is absolutely ingenious. My wife and my daughter love the little animal and I must confess that it fully fulfils its purpose. We will have to get a second one because I fear that my wife will not give the first one any more :) There is a very clear purchase recommendation - 5 thick stars!",Flipcart,5,11-10-20,1,0

The melodies are super pleasant and soothing and I put this otter to the heart of every growing mom, who from time to time is also restless or loses herself too often in her thoughts! ;) The heartbeat and the breathing I have muted, that was a bit suspicious to me.

111,B000G6RYNE,"We bought the slumber otter for our 7 month old daughter. After the introduction of the evening breis she is no longer breast-fed. This made it more difficult for her to fall asleep and I often had to carry her around until she fell asleep. The otter visibly helps her to relax. She smiles at him and croaks him. She does not fall asleep faster but much more gently by means of it.We have convinced the product quality, the sound is clear and the volume control is great. It is very easy to operate. He then plays 30 minutes of music or sounds. The pulsating light and the breathing movements turn off automatically already after 15 minutes. The motor for the breathing movement is heard already, but it looks very sweet. For me, this is more like a gimmick at the older children. But the music/roofs and the gentle light are really very soothing.",Amazon,5,14-05-20,1,1
112,B000G6RYNE,"I learned about the slumber otter through placed advertisements on the Internet. Seen and immediately in love, one can say at this point. Due to the good reviews here (and of course also the infatuation!), we decided to order the slumber otter. What should I say - from the infatuation has become love. Such a wonderful and high-quality product, which can do so much and seems absolutely relaxing even on adults. This cuddly toy is really worth its price.

(at low volume, the music will simply overwhelm) -music playback quality is not satisfactory. (is accompanied by a very high unpleasant whistle tone) Since we wanted to use this stuffed animal mainly as a music clock, this is unfortunately unusable for us. I can't agree with the many positive reviews. The Otter (the idea is still good) goes back.",Amazon,3,31-10-22,1,1

In addition, the other sounds such as snoring,heart noise, vessel noise (like the CTG) and the light function! In addition, very sweet as the belly rises and lowers when ""breathing"". All functions can be displayed separately as it pleases the child (or adult). Also nice that the volume can be adjusted and the otter (without inner) can be washed. Absolutely you don't have to have it, but my little one and I are happy about it every day! He doesn't fall asleep yet, but the music calms him nice and if he isn't tired he is happy about the light, the music and the breathing movement.

119,B000G6RYNE,"We could have used this otter much earlier. It is the best sleep aid for our daughter (7 months old) so far and not to think away. The music plays for a long time and has a pleasant tempo (not like most playing clocks) so that the mouse has enough time to fall asleep. We also like to use the breathing noise especially at night when it gets a bit restless. The otter can be restarted by a slight pressure on the belly. The engine noise (only when breathing movement) which is often mentioned here, I also feel rather calm monotonous. Unfortunately, the engine for the breathing movement after only 1 month failed because the batteries were not strong enough. We have now inserted ""ordinary"" batteries and everything works again. Thumbs high, absolute purchase recommendation! Only the price could be a little cheaper.",Twitter,5,18-11-22,1,1
121,B000G6RYNE,"I tried playing clocks and two other sleeping aids for my baby before and was never convinced that they would simply stop too fast or are too loud or bad in sound. I'm excited about the otter. The volume can be adjusted, the music plays thirty minutes and the light pulsates pleasantly. In addition, the otter is designed with attention to detail.My little one fell asleep during the first attempt.If it takes longer times, you just have to press on the stomach and the last setting is repeated.One criticism point: the light goes out after 10 minutes, which irritates him if he doesn't sleep yet.",Amazon,5,01-11-22,1,1
122,B000G6RYNE,"We love this sweet otter. My little one sleeps very badly and finds it hard to get into deep sleep. The otter does not help to fall asleep, but sleeps again. When she falls asleep in the stroller, we turn on it when we are at home and she sleeps much more quietly and does not wake up immediately. I find it particularly great that you can adjust the volume. It is intuitive and easy to operate and all functions can be operated individually. Mostly we only have the sweet snoring on, sometimes quiet music to calm down. If she has it in her arm already breathing, but here actually disturbs the noise of the engine. The advantage to the music clock is that the otter is much quieter and plays for half an hour. Ging also with the mobile phone, but first of all, I need my mobile phone myself. We are very happy.",Instagram,5,30-01-20,,1

It's a pity that you have to use a lot of strength to push the heart down on your stomach (then cracks very loudly) so that he runs for 30 minutes.

Besides, the outer part can be washed well. Unfortunately, it did not work at all in our case. We have already had it for a few months and it uses nothing up to now. On the contrary, if our baby hears it / looks it wants to play with it and becomes even more awake it misses because purpose completely - we would have been incredibly happy for a sleep aid. Moreover, the electronic unit in the belly is still very hard through the fabric - if the otter is swirled around and hits the head, that is not exactly pleasant (yes, really so happened). Otherwise it is really very beautiful - he is now just a very expensive, hard cuddly animal with special effects.",Amazon,3,15-01-21,,1
126,B000G6RYNE,"Our otter arrived today, much faster than indicated, :) It is totally cute, super fluffy and makes a good impression qualitatively. The melodies and sounds are very clear and not ""bleachy"" or scratchy. Really pleasant to listen to. The engine for breathing is as I don't find at all too loud as it is described in some reviews. You hear it very easily, but I don't feel it annoying. What I also think is great is that you can adjust the otter individually, tunes or sounds, breathing on or off, light on or off, several volumes, there are quite a lot of possibilities and I think there is something for every baby. For me there is a single minus point, for my taste the otter should like to be a little louder, for which one should use the quietest level it does not entirely open to me because then you can hardly hear anything. But that is also just a small downside. I would recommend the otter to everyone whose baby needs some help to fall asleep. Is surely also a very great gift for birth since it can be used from day on :)",Flipcart,5,07-12-20,,0

Looks cute, unfortunately you can only turn on the different functions if you open the back with Velcro closure, which is quite loud. Also the loud can only be set like this. Too bad, because actually I like the functions and my son also likes to listen to the music to fall asleep. Would only like to change the noise or the volume, but this is not possible without opening the otter. Only on and off goes without opening.

The light has a beautiful and attractive luminosity, the breathing movements also have a special attraction. To make any new settings, you have to open a Velcro fastener on Otti's back each time and press various buttons, which are however well represented. However, it is very positive that you can simply press Otti's belly if you want to start it again with the same settings. The engine noises for the breathing movements are indeed quite loud and clear to hear, but it doesn't bother us either. Compared to similar products, I find the price for this completely in order.

The pressing of the belly around the last setting to activate again is easy, also for the baby. The sense of the roaring belly that moves does not open up to me, but many babies like that. We would also like to keep it very much, but the electronic unit is apparently too big with motor etc., so that the otter is too heavy to be kept by a baby. We would simply be afraid that the otter falls on the face if our little one gets taken up somehow.

He has some melodies and also a noise or sweet snoring on offer. I find handling a bit more difficult, because you have to open your back to change volume or mode. Nevertheless a nice companion and I am happy when our baby is in the world. Fast shipping, get on primeday cheaper.",Flipcart,5,14-11-20,,1
163,B000G6RYNE,"I was only skeptical, because my daughter only fell asleep for 12 months while still and cuddly animals hardly pays attention. Thought also that the light could rather disturb than help when falling asleep. Well, I was taught a better one! At Christmas I gave it away, we had nothing to lose and now it has become a ritual to turn on the otter in the evening and the light is pleasantly soft, warm and becomes in the rhythm of the breath brighter and darker. The breathing noise hears it most. Simply hammer!!! ***** Selection of melodies is top, volume control top quality top and batteries were also present. The only thing you CAN complain about: For example, if you want to switch from the breathing noise to music you have to do this manually, i.e. the Velcro closure at the back (sticks bomb-proof, because good quality) and then open and close again. However, it is still great, because you can wash the otter also after the inner life has been removed. But if you listen to the same thing as we do every evening, you simply press the belly and the otter is on or turn off again ;",Amazon,5,10-01-20,,1
164,B000G6RYNE,"Very cute look and works well but I would have liked to have a little more cuddly character. Due to the noise module, the otter is quite heavy, even for adults...my daughter therefore always needs help if she wants to wear it. In addition, I find it a bit worrying especially with small children that the noise module is very easy to access (only by Velcro ""protected"")...would have wanted me more child safety",Facebook,3,22-04-20,,1
165,B000G6RYNE,"The slumber otter was bought as a gift for a baby party. The parents were very happy about this unique gift. We are also glad that we did not decide for one of the many Pinterest ideas (windling places etc.), because this was too high. We have still decorated the otter with sweets and a congratulations card for quiet evenings/nights. For all those who also need a gift they should access here.",Twitter,5,06-10-20,,0
167,B000G6RYNE,"The slumber otter is actually a nice product. The sounds as well as the ""breathing"" of the animal are soothing and the music is wonderful. I was really excited about the otter that I bought as a gift for a newborn. Unfortunately, after barely two weeks of use, he already had a defect, because the music and the breathing movement did not work properly anymore. Amazon quickly made a remedy and so I was able to exchange the product for the friends I had given it to. Unfortunately, the second product after not even two months of use also shows the error, which is very sad and leads to the fact that I will not give the otter any more. :/",Instagram,2,11-02-21,1,1
168,B000G6RYNE,"So our little one calms down very well with Otti, at first she didn't fall asleep but was distracted almost the whole time or inspected him more closely. Meanwhile she also falls asleep with him and keeps her hand on the moving belly between time and time again.Can Otti only recommend :)Of course the motor is a bit clunky but doesn't really bother. The engine is running very quietly so far despite frequent use. All in one was a good investment",Flipcart,5,25-07-20,,0
169,B000G6RYNE,"Our 2 month old son loves the otter. He plays different melodies, snorting and breathing sounds, heartbeat as well as white noise. In addition, the belly cover moves and shines - which can be switched off or switched on. Especially the white noise is very popular here in case of restlessness or to fall asleep.The volume can be regulated wonderfully and is absolutely sufficient. The electronics can be easily removed to clean the otter. Besides, the otter is also really cute to look at. We would definitely buy it again.",Amazon,5,20-01-21,,1
170,B000G6RYNE,"Actually a nice idea, the functions are very nice and reassuring. Our daughter 15 months found him great.Now the big hook comes: he does not work any more after a short time, always goes off on his own and can then no longer be switched on.He was returned and ordered elsewhere, but also the second one there was the same problem. Also this was returned and we don't want any more. Battery change (supplied batteries are probably only intended for demo purposes in the shop) helped nothing at all.",Flipcart,1,08-02-20,1,1
171,B000G6RYNE,"Like myself, the otter was given for our still unborn daughter, but I always put it on her stomach and play the music before her, that's great about it that I can regulate the volume and the whole thing is finished after 30 minutes by itself.To this there are several functions of noises etc., which certainly have a very relaxing effect for a baby.I am very excited about him and he seems very reassuring.My niece (3) was so excited about this when visiting that the aunt did not miss it, to fulfill her desire for her own otter at Christmas and this is no longer to think away from her. She only sleeps with him!",Amazon,5,31-01-21,,0
173,B000G6RYNE,"I find it a bit hard to cuddle through the engine in the abdomen. But the fur and the head are very soft and cuddly. I find the engine quite loud. What makes our little ones scare up is the Velcro clasp on the back of the otter. This one must always open to press the buttons, quite loud. A small zipper or push buttons would be better here.Everything in all, however, the otter is cute, plays sleepy songs, mimics heartbeat, breathing and noise.",Facebook,4,05-01-21,,1
174,B000G6RYNE,"Super sweet sleeping aid for babies, pleasant melody and the light and the sound of the heartbeat is very soothing. Much better than a music box.

Didn't even have to send it back. Nice seller. Would I buy again and again.",Twitter,5,31-10-20,,1

176,B000G6RYNE,"Basically a good product only unfortunately not thought to end. The otter lies with in the bed and seduces to cuddle only unfortunately the otter together with the inside lying operating unit is very hard and heavy and when breathing it crawls. Furthermore, this super nice shell on the belly so interesting to press around that is played rather instead of sleeping. In addition, everyone who has a relative skillful child notices that it also has the Velcro closure open within a very short time and presses around on the control unit.",Flipcart,3,14-11-22,1,1

The device can be taken from the otter, so it can also be washed. For me a very clear purchase recommendation, certainly also arrives very well as a gift for freshly baked parents! I would have been very happy about it.",Amazon,5,05-11-20,,0
179,B000G6RYNE,"The plush animal in itself is very nice and well processed, cuddly and neutral in the smell. The technique consists of a block of hard plastic in which everything is installed. Personally, I find that the device is not soft enough embedded in the stuffed animal. So you notice the hard one very clearly. But my wife finds it great, especially to bring our 6 weeks young daughter to sleep.",Flipcart,5,01-12-22,,1
180,B000G6RYNE,The small slumber otter is really sweet.. It is very quiet about the noise setting (the motor for the belly movement) and the music can also be controlled well in the volume.. The shell on the belly is also provided with light which can also be switched off... I am very happy also with the processing... Very soft fabric.. It could be slightly more fed but with some fabric in addition inside it is also solved.. The ECU inside is a little big but very easy made understand.. Very soft keystroke no clapping.. Would I recommend it because it simulates also heart tone and blood flow sounds like in the womb which certainly seems very soothing... So then make yourself a picture of it.. 9 out of 10 points which someone needs a classification... ,Amazon,4,19-10-20,,1
181,B000G6RYNE,"We are super satisfied with the otter. Not only does it look cute, but the noises also come very well with my little one. The light is not too bright and the breath movement is even, even though it is not very natural. However, we only use the sounds because my little one doesn't care about the other functions. Nevertheless, I find that the otter has earned five stars. The volume can be easily adjusted that it is not too loud. If you are looking for a nice gift no matter whether girl or young, I am sure that it always comes well.",Flipcart,5,12-02-21,,1
182,B000G6RYNE,"In itself I find the otter great, unfortunately we had already for the second time a model, which after a few weeks is defective.

The different sounds, songs, the light and also the optics are very nice and soothing and our daughter has become so accustomed to falling asleep with the little (and I also ) that we will now probably or badly order one for the third time and hope that this will last longer this time!!!",Amazon,2,01-02-21,1,1

As a gift for newborns I find it more than suitable!",Facebook,4,09-11-20,,0
184,B000G6RYNE,"This otter convinced even my very sceptical husband immediately! He helped my daughter straight away. The otter was a very strong recommendation from my friend, who uses it with her son and he immediately falls asleep. But it not only helps my baby to fall asleep but even calms me down. It is always 30 minutes. First the abdominal movement goes out after 10 minutes and then after another 10 minutes the pleasant light, followed after another 10 minutes of the set noise.Real class!!! We would buy it again and again and give it to fresh parents!!!",Twitter,5,16-01-21,,1

Does so even with my daughter(4 years) which sometimes has real difficulties falling asleep. So is also something for older children. Conclusion I would buy it again every time and is also a great gift for freshly baked parents. Also suitable for fruits because there is the function where you can only turn on the heartbeat is then almost like in Mama's belly.",Amazon,5,18-08-20,1,1

187,B000G6RYNE,"The otter is at first glance very sweet, BUT the electronic part is totally thick and noticeable, so that the otter is hardly suitable for cuddles.

188,B000G6RYNE,Our twins Dear Emmet (as we have baptized him) The only thing I have to complain about is that you can't hire him to play longer. After 30 minutes the music is off. I would have wished that you could decide for yourself because if the babies are restless I would need 1h or 1 1/2h. So I have to get up and go on again.

189,B000G6RYNE,"The otter is incredibly cute and invites you to cuddle. You can switch between different melodies, snoring, heartbeat and rasping, you can adjust that it makes breathing movements and that its belly glows.

He has a very good choice of music. My son (3 years old) doesn't want to fall asleep without him anymore. Even the movements of the belly are quiet and with the turn on of the light children no longer have any fear in the dark.A second otter was already worried for my niece, because the enthusiasm of the parents is also great.",Facebook,5,16-09-20,,1

I gave him to her because she often got very quenchy at lunchtime. With ""Otti"" this works better now. You can adjust different melodies and sounds. His belly lifts and lowers. I give him more often because he is not only sweet, but really helps to fall asleep and so relieves everyone a little bit and he always gets very good.",Twitter,5,13-12-20,,1

Volume can be regulated and by pressing on the belly can deactivate the set function as well as activate again - this is great! You just have to love it!

Not too bright, very warm light which alternately becomes brighter and darker again. All in all a great music box.",Flipcart,5,23-01-21,,1
200,B001EPPFGO,"I am very satisfied with the slumber otter. You can adjust the volume of the music individually & I like the choice of the sleeping songs that it plays.

Because you can feel the engine very clearly. That's why there is also the one point deduction.",Amazon,4,14-01-21,,1
202,B001EPPFGO,Would the part buy again and again and find it very well suited as a gift. It plays several melodies and simulates breathing and heart sounds.

I have already ordered several times for young children with friends and family and was always one of the best gifts and investments.The noise level is fine. The smooth movement of the belly calms the baby and the otter conveys a situation similar to that in the mother's belly.

Due to the adjustable volume you can control the noise level. This disturbed me to the normal mobiles arg, because the meanwhile are so loud that you can hardly talk normally. I can not think it away at all. Our small mouse (3 months) sleeps every evening with it and is totally relaxed. The best thing is that you can remove the electrical part from the middle and thus wash the Otter super. Therefore, at any time a recommendation value and I would give it away also every time.

With us the Ottie ""sniffs"" the function is great because my husband and also I are snoring or breathing in the sleep sound. So I can get up again in the evening. He is very fluffy. Alas, if he could be even more upholstered. Since the ""machine"" is still quite hard when you get it to the head. XD.That the belly moves still as if it really breathes is very soothing.

The engine for the breathing movement is relatively loud, especially if the environment is very quiet, like for example to fall asleep and also the quietest volume of the melodies / sounds is not yet quiet enough for our taste. 2.

Super also that the volume can be adjusted individually. My daughters got the otter with 5 weeks - now it is 9 weeks and starts to look at the light and grab!We are absolutely satisfied and I am sure that with increasing age the other functions with joy will come to use! Which also totally inspires me, that you can take the music part inside out quite easily, and the otters can give so in the washing machine!Absolutely recommend further and especially useful for newborns!",Facebook,5,19-11-20,,0
254,B000G6MBX2,"My niece doesn't like it. When switched on and off, the cuddly toy sucks enormously. It looks cute and fluffy, but also hard because of the electronics. So no real cuddly toy. I wouldn't buy it again.",Twitter,3,17-11-20,,1
255,B000G6MBX2,Price/Performance Top! The slumber otter has several functions that can be combined with each other. Light music (very pleasant volume) Breathe heartbeat belly rhythmically up and down move. The otter runs 30 minutes and then goes out. Highly recommended!

257,B000G6MBX2,Just recommended and not to think away from our household anymore. Our son got the otter at just under 3 months at Christmas. Since he is plagued by colics a somewhat restless child we tried a lot to create calm. Since we have the otter it works great! He tries to crawl into it formally in it is so sweet! Only disturbing point are they perceptible engine noises while lifting and lowering the chest. The little one obviously doesn't mind! We use it exclusively during the day when the little one is under observation. At night I see the danger that he could suffocate because he is really pressing his face on the otter.,Amazon,5,04-02-20,,0
259,B000G6MBX2,My little one sleeps very well with it. He looks cute is half well upholstered and that would definitely be better. He can be washed what was very important to me and after a short period of frustration when the breathing was no longer in and let it be turned off now everything works fine again.,Flipcart,5,26-05-20,,1
260,B000G6MBX2,"The otter is very soft and well processed. The inside is removable, so that the cuddly toy can be washed. Operation is simple and easy to use. Nevertheless, this sleep aid is only partially suitable for babies. The engine that lifts our stomach is unfortunately so loud that it completely overcomes the soothing sounds when they are set to a quiet volume. If the sounds are at maximum volume, you still hear the engine. This is quite annoying. Since we can't use this product to fall asleep with all the functions (only lift and lower the belly), we decided to return the product.",Amazon,2,07-12-22,,1
261,B000G6MBX2,"My daughter is totally on the otter. However, after 2 months of intensive use he has a problem. The engine for the belly no longer works and the hum of the engine is hardly overhearable and almost overcomes the loudest attitude of the music level.When I bought this little guy at the time I paid almost 60€. I have to say honestly for the short life is to me in hindsight but I would have expected that he will last longer.",Facebook,5,18-11-20,,0

263,B000G6MBX2,The otter is really a great gift for the little ones among us. Due to the different tones and melodies a good sleep help.

266,B000G6MBX2,"An optically totally sweet playmate. The varied and individually controllable functions convince me, the engine also does not feel as too loud. However, the control element is very large and also heavy for small children's hands. In addition, the cuddly otter from the back is not well lined, so that you can feel the edges of the engine strongly. For this there was a star trigger, because it takes on cuddly quality. I will add something to our otter from the back to make it softer. The necessary space is available in the music box.",Amazon,4,07-06-20,,1
267,B000G6MBX2,"My children love him!! First of all I bought the otter for my 1 year old son, because it took him a long time to fall asleep and was constantly awake at night. But also my daughter (3 years) and also I can sleep great with the sounds! I use the mother's body noises, the music box and the other functions I do not use. Due to the adjustable volume you can adjust the sounds individually. My son cuddles with the otter and falls asleep in a few minutes. When he wakes up at night, I press the otter only briefly and my son falls asleep quickly again. New batteries last relatively long! (approx. 1 month) Only criticism: with older children the breath function does not work if the otter is held sideways in the arm or the arm is placed over the belly of the otter. therefore I have completely disabled the function, as the otter would otherwise constantly shut off.",Flipcart,5,15-11-22,,1

Now I get this one here, which works normally, but: the quality of the fabric is not the same! The Otter has only a ""painted"" face, while the other one was embroidered with the nose, whiskers and the mouth. Which is of course qualitatively inferior with the replacement now! I will probably have to send it in again and hope to get a reasonable replacement until the birth of my child. At the price one should expect that!",Amazon,1,22-01-21,,1

1293,B000JWEEB0,"The small otter is immediately closed into the heart. It has such a nice design and is cuddly despite electronics. You can remove the inner life with cotton wool and you already have a normal stuff animal. The otter has various functions such as breathing noises, (the cleanest snoring in the world), sleeping melodies (finally quiet sounds and no hectic playing clock-climbing) or simply noise. If you lift the breathing movement activated and lowers the belly, unfortunately not quite noise-free. On the belly is also a small lamp built in which lights up during activity. Very nice. I particularly like that the volume can be adjusted, depending on need. Everything can be switched separately and with a slight pressure on the belly started or stopped. There is also an automatic shut-off after a certain time, which I find very practical! It is definitely a great companion for the very small ones and certainly also later! Positive: optics, function, design Neutral: electronics, engine noise Negative:",Facebook,5,09-09-22,17,0
1314,B005J4ZMR8,"I have to say that the otter looks incredibly sweet and I have fallen in love with it. Of course it was tried out immediately. There is a velcro closure behind it, when you open it you have the device in front of you where you can change batteries and also the different modes can choose There are two volume buttons ( loud and quiet ) adjustable in three volumes below there is the button to play music. Then there is the button to set noises that come by chance ( mother's womb sounds ) these remind me the heart tones of the child what you hear during ultrasound, then there is still the heartbeat and the breathing noise. The sounds come by chance you can't pick them out. Then there is the button that the otter breathes and a button for light. I have to say that the music is really soothing and even for us as adult is beautiful. The breath actually looks very realistic, but you can hear the engine very clearly, what can be perceived as disturbing. The otter is really nice to have the music played and the otter has not been able to breathe.",Twitter,4,22-08-22,9,1
1318,B008L19ZQ0,"The slumbery otter comes with batteries, so you can start right away.It looks very sweet and I look very pleasantly soft despite the electronics. Generally very well processed. Volume can be adjusted. The different functions can be combined. The speaker is very pleasant, no too high tones and also no scratches. The motor is heard during the belly movements, but not as bad as I think. If the motor encounters too high resistance, then everything goes out and it stops.You can also switch it off completely. In the packaging it is attached with a cord and a plastic part, which is removed with a 90 degree rotation. If you put the plastic part back in again sounds are short to hear and then the buttons are without function.I like the slumber otter very well, melody and sounds are pleasant and soothing. The Gösse also fits very well and the condition very simply.",Amazon,5,22-08-22,4,1
1324,B008L19ZQ0,"A really great, kleijer Otter, nice as a sleep aid for the baby. Very soft and fluffy, nice to cuddle and an ideal gift for birth. Because if a baby accepts this otter as a sleep aid and uses it, then only the attempt helps. You can not estimate that before. The small otter makes music or sounds, e.g. heartbeat or snoring. The batteries are already inserted and therefore of course included in the scope of delivery. I like the breathing, the belly moves visibly with the breathing, super-sweet. You can expand the battery part well and wash the otter thus well. There is a long, hidden Velcro connector at the back. At the battery compartment you can also make various settings. ZB sleep and snarch sounds, various, light piano music, volume, light and up to 30 minutes running time. A great idea, we like very well. Unfortunately, I have already discovered on this fluffy fur on the 1st view 2 draw threads. For this I pull off 1 star. That should happen with baby toys from the company is also good for older cases.",Instagram,4,25-08-22,2,1
1326,B008L19ZQ0,"I immediately fell in love with the little one when I saw him. Although I spent some time with the little one, because I don't let any children sleep here myself, I finally got him. I always have friends with her baby to visit and thought, so I could give the dwarf a more pleasant time here, if we sit longer. The little animal is really very cute, however, with me the picture is much better set in scene, than the original. The good one looks something, as if he had run against a wall. But beside the flat, somewhat wide head, it is still quite inseparable, however. If the content is not there. The electronics can be removed very easily by a Velcro lock in the back and operated. The surrounding body, which therefore represents the otter, is soft and fluffy, but to me almost thin. You feel the content nevertheless very strongly and I have some concerns, if the child would roll on it (to be lucky babies that will be quite rare). Here I would have just wished for some more light, the edges are not clearly the same as well as well as the rest of the rest.",Flipcart,4,29-08-22,2,1
1328,B008L19ZQ0,"We have ordered this slumber otter from Fisher-Price for our 2nd child. We were still looking for a music box and have definitely found it with this otter. What we noticed first, it is so fluffy and soft. That even our big ones liked it very much. It also looks really cute. It is operated with 4 AA batteries. The otter has different melodies that it can play, you can further adjust whether the baby sounds like a heartbeat, which should hear calm breathing while sleeping or hair dryer noises. The volume is also adjustable, which I like very much, because you have a predetermined volume for most of the playing clocks. You can also adjust at the operating unit whether the otter should glow in the middle and whether it should imitate breathing movements. The operating unit can be easily removed at the back by the Velcro closure and thus the otter wash small. In addition, according to the label you should wash it at low temperature and supposedly even in the dryer at low temperature, you can dry it. However, I would like to throw it into the dryer for safety. Therefore, I can't wash it very clearly.",Amazon,5,25-08-22,1,1
1330,B008L19ZQ0,"The otter looks simply cuddly. It has a friendly face, is soft and fluffy and can become the first plush friend for every baby. It is quite expensive, almost forty euros, but the price is quite justified. The otter is not only a simple musical clock that you raise, and then always comes the same melody. It has several different melodies on offer, which can play up to 30 minutes. The volume can be regulated. In addition, the otter gives breath sounds of itself on request, the chest of the stuffed animal lifts and lowers, and also the heartbeat can be made audible. On the belly of the otter a soft, yellowish light shines, which gradually becomes weaker and then runs out. For a baby, the otter therefore looks really real and has a calming effect when falling asleep. The four batteries required are included. The cover of the otter can be washed without ""intments"", so without electronics, well in the machine. I find this plush animal very cute and absolutely suitable for babies as sleeping companions.",Flipcart,5,20-08-22,1,1
1333,B00845LR4G,"The Slommer Otter music box by Fisher-Price is half-open packed in a cardboard box, so it looks like the cuddly animal is lying in a cradle. Nice design. Included in the delivery are 4 AA batteries, through which the music box is operated. The product is clean, unoccupied and does not secrete any odors. The otter combines some functions: It is cuddly toy, music box, light... You can set music, heartbeat and sleep sounds among others, lighting and movement. The keys to adjust are to be operated on the music box itself, for which you open the Velcro at the back of the otter. The little otter appeals. It is cuddly, has a friendly face and a pleasant size. The music box is removable from the inside, so that the otter itself can be washed in the machine. An aspect that is important in my opinion for small children. The product is certainly suitable as a gift.",Amazon,5,26-08-22,1,1
1335,B005O072PC,"The little otter is delivered in its cardboard bed. It is made of fluffy, soft material, but rather we look like a teddy (Otter is usually narrower built). The inner life of the otter consists of the actual music box. The otter cover can be removed and also washed. On the back there is the opening, which is secured with a Velcro closure. It is operated with 4 1.5V AA batteries, which are already in place in the device (inner life of the otter). If you look at this music box more closely, you can find back buttons for volume control, a button for 30 minute playing of soothing music, the second button serves to select the piece (nature, background noise, snoring or heartbeat), the third button starts a 10 minute movement (the belly) of the otter – and another button allows the light to shine for 15 minutes, which is shimmering through the small belly. All settings can be set out miraculously by pressing the corresponding button. A user manual in numerous languages is included. Conclusion: I like this soft, sweet otter provides a good touch for the baby.",Facebook,5,23-08-22,1,1
1340,B005O072PC,"The little otter slumbers with the baby or toddler and it can be programmed by mom or dad in such a way ""that a pressure on the paw print on the belly suffices and the program runs off.

The control element for setting is accessible via a Velcro closure on the back. For the laundry of the otter now and then you can take out this unit and use it again later. That's well explained in the instructions for use. You just have to look for a little bit, because all steps are described in 16 languages - and these are among them. That could certainly have been better marked, e.g. with a country shortcut in front of every text. The paws of the otter are sewn to his chest. Also, I find this a little bit of shame. I personally would have liked a Velcro closure better. The processing is perfect and the material of high quality.

In fact, he has fallen asleep two times when the part was lying on his belly while he was cuddled in my arm. However, he has got caught up in it and surrounded him directly awake and cried. If it is in his bed, he turns away from it. During the day he does not touch the thing and makes a big bow around it. So it is not suitable for him. What I like is that you can wash the animal. I don't like that it is not suitable for cuddling because of the large, hard plastic part because it is too hard.

The plush animal not only looks heart-like, it also offers many possibilities to make the falling asleep sounds according to my own preferences. Music, breath sounds, two different types of heartbeat, white noise (which actually sounds more like a vacuum cleaner), with or without light or breathing movements; everything can be adjusted by pressing a button when the otter is opened at the back of the Velcro closure. The electronics can also be completely removed to wash the otter in the machine if necessary. Only when closing it has to be taken care not to accidentally press one of the buttons, otherwise the desired attitude is gone again. Personally, however, the engine noise when lifting and lowering the belly is less disturbing to me than the fact that the breathing noises, if activated, are not synchronous to the movements.",Amazon,5,29-08-22,,1

1369,B005O072PC,"Our little one was already able to calm down as an infant from the ""baby noise app"", but a mobile phone is probably not the right sleeper for a baby. The otter can play various soothing sounds or, falling asleep music - the volume can be individually adjusted. Optionally it moves his bellies up and down, which shines as desired. The slumber otter is super soft, does not smell like plastic and is the perfect sleeping companion. To this end, it is gender-neutrally designed and is delivered into his own small bed. Even if it is only about the packaging, the idea to melt there is. Our little one loves to sleep in with his new friend and even forgets his pacifier from time to time.

However, the sounds are particularly familiar to the baby. Otti can play a baby heart tone, but also that of Mommy. Or he makes typical breathing sounds... Also a pleasant light can let Otti shine in his belly. All this calms the child and it sleeps quickly and well.

The otter was adopted from the start. Our baby was turning her head towards her, and her head was held up by the plush. The noises are very soothing. Personally I use the heartbeat, my baby loves. The noise that mimics a breath is very well as well, and another noise mimics the sounds in utero, very useful I think for a new baby. As soon as it turned well our son started to take the otter in his arms as soon as he was lying in his cradle. I see three negative points. - the tissue of the teddy is not oeko tex, I advise to wash it before giving it to baby. - the nightlight is a little too powerful, especially if baby keeps his face all against the otter. - it would be very useful to add this noise to the baby.

The light emanating from the belly is very soft and felty, because it passes through the coat of the pestiole. And once you have tightened in your arms you can't see it anymore. The musics are very soothing, the volume adjustment is top, you can fall down as it pleases. This allows the child to activate his doudou during the night without disturbing those who sleep next door. The noise of the mechanism is barely audible, with its almost minimum and teddy closed.
